This repository provides a simple yet effective CV template using basic LaTeX commands. The BASE ROVER template requires only about 10 lines of code to set up a clean r√©sum√© format. For your one-page resume, there's no need for any custom resume class. This template leverages the full power and flexibility of LaTeX, allowing you to customize every aspect without the constraints of predefined classes. 

These templates are designed with ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility in mind, featuring single-column layouts that ensure your r√©sum√© is easily parsed. By using standard LaTeX commands, they maintain a clear and organized structure, making it simple for both ATS software and recruiters to quickly identify key details.

If you have any questions about using this template or formatting your r√©sum√©, please feel free to post them in the [Discussions](https://github.com/subidit/rover-resume/discussions) section. And don't forget to star the repository if you find it useful! üåü
