These templates are designed with ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility in mind, featuring single-column layouts that ensure your résumé is easily parsed. By using standard LaTeX commands, they maintain a clear and organized structure, making it simple for both ATS software and recruiters to quickly identify key details.
