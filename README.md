This repository provides a simple yet effective CV template using basic LaTeX commands. The BASE ROVER template requires only about 10 lines of code to set up a clean r√©sum√© format. This should give you a solid foundation to build upon and customize as needed.

To maintain ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility, all templates in this repository are designed as single-column layouts. Additionally, standard LaTeX commands are used to preserve a clear hierarchical structure within the r√©sum√©, making it easy for recruiters to skim and quickly identify key information.

If you have any questions about using this template or formatting your r√©sum√©, please feel free to post them in the [Discussions](https://github.com/subidit/rover-resume/discussions) section. And don't forget to star the repository if you find it useful! üåü
