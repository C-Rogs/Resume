### Remember

- Single column layout is the preffered choice of both recruiters and ATS.
- Don't use graphs to show your skill levels as they don't really mean anything.
- Good design is simple and effective. 
- Information is king. Maintain hirarchy by repeating similar text blocks.
- Make it easy for the recruter to skim the document and find the information he is looking for.
- You can use ChatGPT to give a job description and get related bullet points for your past experiences.
