## Tips & Tricks

- Single column layout is the preffered choice of both recruiters and ATS.
- Don't use graphs to show your skill levels as they don't really mean anything.
- Good design is simple and effective. 
- Information is king. Maintain hirarchy by repeating similar text blocks.
- Make it easy for the recruter to skim the document and find the information he is looking for.
- You can use ChatGPT to give a job description and get related bullet points for your past experiences.

## Milky Rover

Based on (rather copied from) the [Butterickâ€™s practical typography](https://practicaltypography.com/resumes.html) resume template. I used the same text to make it easier for comparison. Bigest hardle was to get a similar look without using the same fonts. Since I had to use only free fonts available with TeX installation, I had to adjust the letterspacing in rather hacky way. Anyway, I feel the end result looks pretty decent.
